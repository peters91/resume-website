        <p>
          I recently graduated from University of Washington in Seattle, with a Bachelors in History.
          I didn’t originally start out to get a degree in History, I was originally interested in
          pursuing computer science. At Edmonds community college I had taken all the calculus series
          classes they offered plus a few extra to prepare for this choice. However, after a few
          Intro to Java courses at Edmonds Community College and one at UW I found I didn’t enjoy
          the syntactically strict algorithmic backend language.
        </p>

        <p>
          I stumbled into love with History after taking a Colonial History class my first quarter
          at UW. It wouldn’t be until a few quarters later that I truly fell in love with the research
          process. In a class at UW called The City we had an end of quarter project where we created
          a website based off our research of a block on the Seattle Waterfront. I had the blocks
          between Blanchard and Lenora. I spent months pouring over old Seattle newspapers,
          insurance maps, going through the UW digital archives, reading articles and visiting the
          current site. The project gave me a deeper understanding of Washington State and the city of
          Seattle. I caught the research bug with that project. My interest in research expanded with
          a research paper for a class on Postwar Japan. We got to pick the topic to research with
          professor’s approval. I researched Japans pop culture mediums before, during and after
          World War II. Not only did I learn how politics influences pop culture, I also learned the
          power pop culture has over people’s perception. As an enthusiast in pop culture this was a
          very impactful research project for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I got more ingrained in history, I started to look for opportunities to continue
          exploring history and historical research outside of school. I found myself gravitating
          toward Archives and Museums. I started volunteering at National Archives and Records Administration
          and Museum of Pop Culture to help me get a better understanding of what they do and how they
          operate. Volunteering at National Archives and Records Administration gave me a new and
          interesting way to learn. For my first project I was tasked with indexing the McNeil Penitentiary
          prisoner intake forms. I would take the 1940’s handwritten inmate entries by the warden and
          translate them into an excel document. I learned a few interesting federal crimes while
          entering the inmates into the database, Selective Service and Training Act [Draft Dodging],
          N.M.V.T.A [Stolen Vehicle Trafficking]and White Slave Act [Human Trafficking] to name a few.
          It was an incredibly fascinating way to learn history.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose to volunteer at the Museum of Pop Culture because of my deep love of pop culture.
          I wanted to take the opportunity to learn how museums operated and where I would fit into
          the team, being surrounded by iconic pop culture objects was a bonus. It was during a
          volunteer event tour to the MoPop vaults, that I found a deep fascination with the collection’s
          aspect of museums. They wouldn’t let us raid the vaults of course but they pulled a few things
          to give us a taste of what was hidden in their massive collection. I was hooked and so became
          my interest in pursuing a degree in Museology so that I could be the one to interact with
          history and share it in new and interesting ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          When my volunteering at MoPop ended I found an opportunity to internship at the Washington
          State Archive in Bellevue. I volunteered for a few weeks before starting the internship but
          with the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic I was only able to intern for two weeks before it was put on hold.
        </p>

        <p>
          With my internship on hold and heading to cancellation I took the opportunity during the
          pandemic to learn web development. I was apprehensive as my last foray into coding hadn’t
          been the best experience for me but I was willing to give this new language a try. I found
          web development coding to be more interesting and more approachable. The visual aspect of
          it playing into a large part of why I like it so much. With pure back end language, it was
          hard for me to “see” what my code was doing, but with front end language I can see immediately
          what my code is doing in the browser. Which makes it easier for me to understand and troubleshoot.
          It also provided me more opportunity to express myself creatively, which I didn’t feel I could do with Java.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to combine my love of history and research with the web development I am learning and
          implementing. During my web dev class at UW I started this marriage by creating a simple
          history quiz that can be found under the history tab on this website that I also created
          from scratch. Even though the class is over I am still learning and expanding my understanding
          of web development. I’m using this website as a platform to experiment and grow my understanding.
