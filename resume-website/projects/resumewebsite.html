        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a static website created to showcase my current interests,
          goals, and accomplishments. I built this site from scratch using HTML and CSS.
          I started this project to continue practicing my web development skills.
          I incorporated AWS's S3 and Route 53 to host this site.

          The first step in any project is to stop and make a plan. I decided
          what content should be displayed and then laid it out to get the right
          look. It was also important to allow for extensibility in the future.
          Before starting any code, I first wrote out a bio about myself and
          updated my resume. The next step was to design the lay out and pick a
          color scheme. Once the content was created and the design finished it
          was time to start building the site.

          I created my static website using HTML and CSS. The HTML code is the
          structure of the website. The CSS is the style. I used this project to
          push my understanding of both “languages”. The most challenging part of
          the project was dynamically changing content to fit the screen or media
          type. The hamburger menu when the screen went from desktop to tablet or
          mobile was particularly challenging. It did however provide me the
          opportunity to learn how positioning within a web page works.

          I decided to use AWS’s cloud resources to host my site. I chose it
          because it is an industry standard. The free tier option is great for
          beginners. Not to mention it is secure and scalable. I set up S3 buckets
          and secured my domain name with Route 53 through AWS. S3 is an object
          storage service. It provides scalable access to the stored
          website data. Route 53 is AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS) service.
          Choosing Route 53 was convenient as it connects pretty seemlessly with
          other parts of AWS's infrastructure, such as S3 and API Gateway which I
          plan to use in future projects. Now I have a place to store my data
          and to route users to it, I am now able to expand into other services
          they offer.
