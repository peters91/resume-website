        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to build a history quiz webpage which supports
          a wide variety of topics.
          It will allow players to create profiles and choose quiz topics to start or
          continue. It will include both individual and group challenge quiz formats.
          The group challenges are created by a group creator; who names the group,
          selects the quiz the group will take, and invites players to accept the
          challenge. Individual quiz takers can take any quiz as many times as they
          like and their progress will be saved and reported for the most recent
          attempt of each quiz.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a previous project, I introduced myself to AWS for the first time and
          practiced using some of the services like S3 and Route 53. In this
          project, I intend to expand my knowledge into some of AWS's more dynamic
          service offeriings including; Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB services.
          I also hope to learn significantly more about IAM and the principles of
          secure service architectures.

          In May 2020, I made a simple history quiz for my web development class,
          but I wanted to expand on it and utilize enterprise scaled cloud services.
          Before getting started on the tech however, I needed a detailed plan.
          First, I created rough sketches to visualize the end product. Once I
          was happy with the general look, I bought three different size sketchbooks
          to simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. I illustrated each
          web page as a separate sheet to help visualize user actions and noted
          the button event handlers on each page to track interactions. Once I
          finished, I had it reviewed by my family to integrate direct feedback
          into the design. For instance, it was suggested that a create/edit
          player page should be added. I updated my design to include the
          recommendation. I saw the value in allowing players to control their
          information.

          I chose to use DynamoDB by AWS as my database. DynamoDB is both flexible
          and scalable but is also a NoSQL database which is the better fit for
          my needs over a SQL database. I chose NoSQL because of the performance
          and cost benefits. I am mainly doing gets and scans of my DynamoDB
          tables, using partition and sort key values. DynamoDB is cheaper and
          performs these tasks equal to or better than SQL based options. SQL is
          best for structured data, but outside of direct queries and scans, I
          have no need for complex filters or table joins. The scalability of a
          NoSQL database is also an added benefit.
          <br/><br/>
          Once I settled the NoSQL vs. SQL database debate, I designed the tables.
          I listed out the information I would need to access for my site;
          category, quiz, quiz questions, player, group, game, and game index.
          Being less practiced in table design, I had help expanding each table.
          I learned the importance of separating the game information from the
          player and group data. The game data would have been more complicated
          to access for a particular group or player, without separation and indexing.

          While thinking about the project I knew I needed to set up a GitHub
          account to create a web development portfolio. I worked to get my git
          repositories set up and connected to my VS studio. I set all that up
          before getting started on designing the logic and behavior.
          The next step in the project was to design the Application Programming
          Interface (API). APIâ€™s define the interaction between two applications.
          Based on my DynamoDB tables, I needed at least 11 APIs. Before I started
          writing the code, I created the APIDOC detailing the behavior I expected
          based on the request type. The document contains request types, return
          types, descriptions of behavior, examples of requests and returns, and
          error handling for each API. The document is an essential part of the
          build process. Creating a document before writing the code helped me
          break the tasks down into more manageable pieces and provides a
          blueprint to follow that saves time and reduces the risk of errors.

          One of the best things I took away from University was that stopping
          and making a plan is crucial to success. I did a lot of paper writing
          as a history major. I did copious amounts of research for a wide range
           of topics. To write a successful paper I needed sort through my
           research to lay out arguments and provide evidence to support my
           claims. The first few papers taught me where my weaknesses were in my
           planning process. As my college career went on I worked on improving
           my planning strategy. Entering the world of web development, I was
           introduced to Trello as a way to track tasks. I was using sticky notes
           and notebooks before Trello. The time-stamped Trello task cards allow
           me to evaluate the effectiveness of my approach. With sticky notes
           they can get lost or lose meaning the longer your separated from the
           task. The Kanban planning style of Trello over the sticky note method
           allows for better organization of tasks.
          <br/><br/>
          Making a plan cannot be understated. It is important to break down work
          into small manageable pieces with specific goals. Tasks need to be
          measurable. Otherwise motivation, focus, and confidence become difficult
          to maintain.
          For example, a task labeled, work on the project, lacks any direction
          or focus. If the card states, fill the DynamoDB tables with test data,
          there is a measurable start and end. The task is not challenging, but
          the ability to see progress builds confidence in handling more complex
          tasks. My task list was designed to maintain focus, motivation, and
          build confidence.

          In order to manage user quiz data I needed to learn how to use the data
          management tools AWS provides. I needed to learn API Gateway, AWS Lambda
          and DynamoDB. I learned how to integrate API Gateway with AWS Lambda,
          and AWS Lambda to DynamoDB. AWS Lambda lets you run code without
          provisioning or managing servers. API Gateway is an API management
          tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services.
          It protects APIs from overuse and abuse and monitors how the APIs are
          being used.

          <br/><br/>
          I will walk through the process of someone visiting my site and making
          an API call. The request from the user is sent to API Gateway. It routes
          it to AWS Lambda if the name and request type match. The Lambda function
          evaluates the request. The lambda runs the code and interacts with Dynamo
          to get or store (manage) state. The result of that interaction is then
          sent back through API Gateway. And back to the user depending on the
          response logic outside the API call.

          <br/><br/>
          To do this project, I needed to understand how these services interacted
          with each other. I read through the documentation and practiced in the
          AWS console. Once I was comfortable and had a good understanding, I
          built the skeletal structure for the AWS interface. While working on
          this aspect of the project, I became more familiar with Identity and
          Access Management (IAM). IAM allows creation and management of AWS users
          and groups, and uses permissions to allow and deny them access to AWS
          resources. I opted out of using the generic roles and instead created
          specific roles within IAM to fit my specific use cases.

          After all the planning and designing I started building the APIs. I
          started with getQuizList, getQuiz and createPlayer. They do not have
          complex logic and are fairly simple. They grab data from the specified
          table, or in createPlayer case, puts the input from the user into the
          specified table. The APIâ€™s were incredibly helpful in my endeavor to
          learn, deploy and test my code in Lambda. The testing helped me visualize
          the process of API Gateway, AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. The API testing
          helped me correct my assumptions and learn how to approach my more complex
          APIs in a more efficient way. Get Leaderboard was changed from returning
          a game id to returning an array of player ids, total number of questions,
          and the score. Get Answer was created so that I could provide more information
          to the player on the get results page, without overloading the get results
          API. I updated both after correcting my limited understanding when I
          designed them.

          <br/><br/>
          As I built each API I felt more and more comfortable with the tools and
          saw how to improve the APIâ€™s I had yet to build. Get Leaderboard and
          Get Answer were changed and created after I understood how I could
          utilize them better.

          <br/><br/>
          The two robust APIs in my list were newGame and recordAnswer. Both were
          central to setting up state and later reading. New Game had to determine,
          based on inputs, whether the user was a single player or group. It then
          put the new game information in three different tables based on the
          evaluation. Record Answer had to evaluate the given quiz answer with
          the correct answer to get the score. It would then record the given
          answer and score for the given player, quiz, question num in the games
          table.
          The create group, delete group, and playerSignIn were more than the
          simple get and put requests but not as logic heavy as newGame and
          recordAnswer. They fit in complexity with getLeaderboard and getAnswer.
          Thanks to the simple APIâ€™s early on I was able to do these APIâ€™s with
          little trouble and improve upon them as I built them.

          <br/><br/>
          The APIâ€™s built off each other and allowed me to build my confidence
          with each API. Each API helped me stretch my understanding of the AWS
          tools and improve my logic and assumptions.

          In the next step of the project, I started on frontend development.
          The best approach was to focus on the websiteâ€™s buttons. I focused on
          one button at a time. I mapped out how the player would use the buttons
          and what event handler should trigger from the button click. I listed
          out how a player could leave and come back to the site. I wanted to be
          able to save player data if they were to accidentally leave or refresh
          the page in the middle of a quiz. Understanding this behavior helped me
          determine the best order to call, store, and delete player information
          in the local storage. I utilize the local storage to help maintain the
          quiz data.

          <br/><br/>
          I check the existence of data in local storage in key places, like starting
          a quiz, to reduce the risk of overwriting a quiz the player may already
          be taking. It also keeps the site from making unnecessary API calls.
          Making unnecessary API calls can increase latency and cost. My website
          is small enough that the cost is minimal, but if I want to expand in the
          future, I need to build it with scalability in mind.

          As I worked through building the functionality of each button, I came
          across fixes I needed to make to my APIâ€™s. A few of my APIâ€™s like getAnswers
          and getGroupLeaderboard were missing the ability to take the user input
          group name and generate the UUID to make the proper backend calls. I also
          modified the group landing pages, facilitating the need for a new API.
          I created getGroupQuizId and groupSignIn.

          <br/><br/>
          GetGroupQuizId was created to help retrieve the quiz associated with the
          group. GroupSignIn was created to verify that a group exists. Both are
          crucial to the function of the group challenge portion of the website
          and were missed in my first round of planning. Something to watch out
          for in my next project plan.

          I spent this time building each button and addressing issues that popped
          up during the testing. Things like error messages not disappearing when
          they should or having buttons generate before all the information was
          retrieved. I did not have any major issues. I had a few API tweaks as
          mentioned before, some reordering and making a few functions async to
          help reduce the timing issues.

          <br/><br/>
          Once I got the code to where it was working with no errors, I went through
          and refactored my code. I had made logic assumptions that needed to be
          corrected, and I cleaned up functions that had become cluttered. My main
          programming crime was nesting too many if statements and for loops, nothing
          horrendous but more than necessary. With more practice, this will become
          a smaller and smaller occurrence.

          <br/><br/>
          After the fixes, I noticed increased speed from when the button is
          clicked to the generation of the next screen.

          In the final stages of the project, I used CSS to style my web page. I
          wanted to learn to build from the ground up, so I avoided using toolkits
          like bootstrap. It forces me to understand the basics of design before
          I start to use the tools. It was challenging but I feel I gained a lot
          from the process. Positioning pictures was a fun challenge.
          As I continue to expand my knowledge with future projects, I plan to delve
          into these tools.

          <br/><br/>
          The history researcher in me had a really fun time researching and building
          the quiz questions. The CSS helped me bring my vision for the site to life.

          web design, Iâ€™ll be creating top quality web pages in no time.
